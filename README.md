[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lux-org/lux-binder-sql/HEAD)

This repository contains a Demo notebook that overviews how Lux can be used with Postgresql databases. In this Binder instance, Postgres comes pre-installed via Anaconda. This means that you do not have to install Postgres on your local machine in order to use the SQL capabilities for Lux within the demo notebook.
