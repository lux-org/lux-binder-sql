This repository contains a notebook that demonstrates how Lux can be used with Postgres databases. Click on the badge below to launch a live notebook: 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lux-org/lux-binder-sql/master?urlpath=tree/notebooks/Lux-SQL-demo.ipynb)

In the live Binder notebook, Postgres comes pre-installed via Anaconda. This means that you do not have to install Postgres on your local machine in order to use the SQL capabilities for Lux within the demo notebook.
